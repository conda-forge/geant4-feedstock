  description: |
    Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through
    matter. Its areas of application include high energy, nuclear and
    accelerator physics, as well as studies in medical and space science. The
    three main reference papers for Geant4 are published in Nuclear Instruments
    and Methods in Physics Research [A 506 (2003) 250-303](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900203013688),
